I started this blog as a way to aim to expand the knowledge out there of more niche subjects that are not so related to technical aspects of data analytics, (plenty of those out there already), but what it means to be and think like a data scientist as a confluence of computer science and data analytics (plus the perks and pangs of growing up in a third culture). 

There's probably also lots of lovely blogs on technical and more out there, which I would also recommend for eager readers out there.

- List to be expanded in the future as I get more time to read. 

### My story

I'm a data scientist currently figuring out how we can piece together business and data in a smarter way from modelling and causal inferencing. In my free time, I'm curious about maths, music and everything in between.
